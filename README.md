# ML Projects To Do 

I am working on learning and applying AI programs. Most of the work here is open sourced and done with the help of prev. creators. I played with a lot of the programs. All credits are attached within specific applications. I am also working on my Beginner AI Book! 

- Technique: 5-10 small projects (<60 minutes>) in this github + 1 big independent project (>2 hours) every 2 weeks in indivdual githubs

- Learning: Tests, Textbooks, Quizzes, Tutorials, Lectures, Writing

Suggestions can be sent to jefflincreates@gmail.com! Below are accountability measures and updates. 

## Main Techniques

Linear Regression, Classification, Neural Networks, App Development 

## Main libraries

- ML: Pytorch, Tensorflow, Sklearn 
- Deployment: Streamlit
- General: Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Yfinance 

### Projects -> need to play around more 

1. Iris Dataset & Iris App Deployment-> :white_check_mark:
2. Stock Price App -> :white_check_mark:
3. DNA Counter App -> :white_check_mark: 
4. S&P500 Data Scraping -> :white_check_mark:
5. MNIST Dataset -> :white_check_mark: ( need to do more data viz)
6. Boston Housing Regression -> :white_check_mark:
7. Breast Cancer Classification -> :loop:
8. Neural Network From Scratch -> :white_check_mark:
9. Neural Networks with Python and PyTorch -> :white_check_mark:
10. Python Games, Apps, Algorithms -> :loop:
11. Deep Learning with Python and TensorFlow -> :loop:

### Brainstorming
- Streamlit PDF 
- AI Tutor aka Goggins (Colab, API, Streamlit)
- Content Creator 
- Auotmated Content (MidJourney, Dalle)
- Summary AI (text, audio, video)
- Jeff GPT 

#### Mastery Strategy 0 

1. Tutorials & Playground Testing, then teaching 
2. Independent ML Projects with the help of prev. code 
3. Open Course w/ textbook and lectures @ Stanford and Princeton for ML 
4. Algorithms Daily Practice 
5. Kaggling and Reviewing Complex Projects 

#### Mastery Strategy 1 

Implementing Research Paper From Scratch & Reading Papers--> 1 Strong Paper Biweekly, Research Papers:

1. A few useful things to know about machine learning 
2. Handwriting digit recognition with backprop network 
3. Bag of tricks for image classification with convolutional neural networks  
4. YOLO: You Only Look Once  
5. Distilling the knowledge in a neural network  
6. Attention is all you need  
7. An image is worth 16x16 words  
8. RAG for knowledge intensive task NLP  
9. LORA: Low-rank adaptation

#### Mastery Strategy 2 
1. Fine Tuning an Open Source LLM with Google Colab --> TBD.
2. Test taking & Pattern Recognition @Bishop
