# ML Projects To Do (archived)

**Because projects are becoming more advanced and this repo is becoming more complex, new projects will be moved into their own repos. Most of my learning will be on the repo.** 


-------------------

I am working on learning and applying AI programs. Most of the work here is open sourced and done with the help of prev. creators. I played with a lot of the programs. All credits are attached within specific applications. I am also working on my Beginner AI Book! 

- Technique: 5-10 small projects (<60 minutes>) in this github + 1 big independent project (>2 hours) every 2 weeks in indivdual githubs

- Learning: Tests, Textbooks, Quizzes, Tutorials, Lectures, Writing

Suggestions can be sent to jefflincreates@gmail.com! Below are accountability measures and updates. 

## Main Techniques

Linear Regression, Classification, Neural Networks, App Development 

## Main libraries

- ML: Pytorch, Tensorflow, Sklearn 
- Deployment: Streamlit
- General: Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Yfinance 

### Projects -> need to play around more 

1. Iris Dataset & Iris App Deployment-> :white_check_mark:
2. Stock Price App -> :white_check_mark:
3. DNA Counter App -> :white_check_mark: 
4. S&P500 Data Scraping -> :white_check_mark:
5. MNIST Dataset -> :white_check_mark: ( need to do more data viz)
6. Boston Housing Regression -> :white_check_mark:
7. Breast Cancer Classification -> :no_entry:
8. Neural Network From Scratch -> :white_check_mark:
9. Neural Networks with Python and PyTorch -> :white_check_mark:
10. Python Games, Apps, Algorithms -> :warning:
11. Deep Learning with Python and TensorFlow -> :white_check_mark:

### Brainstorming
- Streamlit PDF 
- AI Tutor aka Goggins (Colab, API, Streamlit)
- Content Creator 
- Auotmated Content (MidJourney, Dalle)
- Summary AI (text, audio, video)
- Jeff GPT 

#### Mastery Strategy 0 

1. Tutorials & Playground Testing, then teaching 
2. Independent ML Projects with the help of prev. code 
3. Open Course w/ textbook and lectures @ Stanford and Princeton for ML 
4. Algorithms Daily Practice 
5. Kaggling and Reviewing Complex Projects 

#### Mastery Strategy 1 

Implementing Research Paper From Scratch & Reading Papers--> 1 Strong Paper Biweekly, Research Papers:

1. A few useful things to know about machine learning 
2. Handwriting digit recognition with backprop network 
3. Bag of tricks for image classification with convolutional neural networks  
4. YOLO: You Only Look Once  
5. Distilling the knowledge in a neural network  
6. Attention is all you need  
7. An image is worth 16x16 words  
8. RAG for knowledge intensive task NLP  
9. LORA: Low-rank adaptation

#### Mastery Strategy 2 
1. Fine Tuning an Open Source LLM with Google Colab --> TBD.
2. Test taking & Pattern Recognition @Bishop
